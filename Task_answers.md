## Task Overview: 

**TESTS**

I’ve prepared automated tests for provided site: https://qa-task.backbasecloud.com/. I chose CRUD articles functionality.

You can find it on my github https://github.com/Lina90Karo/cypress_bblog and also in the `cypress_bblog-main` directory. 

Instruction with steps how to run the written test you can find in the [README.md](https://github.com/Lina90Karo/cypress_bblog/blob/main/README.md) file which is located in the test directory and in GitHub repository.


**TEST CASES**

Repository with example test cases you can find here:  https://app.qase.io/project/BBLOG.

**TEST RESULTS**

Test report for executed test cases you can find here: 
https://app.qase.io/run/BBLOG/dashboard/2 (same credentials as above). Please see `Defects` tab for a description of failed testcases. 

In my evaluation, the basic CRUD functionality for articles works fine, although there are some non-critical bugs that should be ironed out in the future.

**BUGS**

I’ve reported some example bugs that I found to a project board specially prepared for this purpose in my trello: https://trello.com/b/MPf23VsN/bblog
